# classification-models
Project in which my partner and I implemented a Naive Bayes Classifier, a K Nearest Neighbors Classifier, and a Support Vector Machine classifier and used them on different sets of classification data.

All of our code is in ClassificationModels.py.  The rest of the files are just data.
